                        <h2>In NYC alone there are over 58,000 people who are homeless</h2>
                        <p>
                            In NYC many who are homeless happen to be people of color. What seems to be agreed upon is that one of the main
                            reasons for homelessness is due to lack of affordable housing. Over <strong>19,000</strong> are apart of families and 
                            over <strong>19,000</strong> are children. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With so many people homeless, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/index.html#/?chapt=1" target="_blank">
                            Dasani</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/karol/">Karol</a>
                            was apart of these statistics. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to the<em> Coaltition For The Homeless</em>, at least <strong>90%</strong> of the homeless are minorities. It is clear 
                            that minorities are disproportionately affected by homelessness. In recent years, the homeless population has increased and 
                            reached it's highest level since 1930's
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the course of the 2019 fiscal year there has been about <strong>132,660</strong> different homeless people. 
                            According to the same study, this number also includes <strong>44,300</strong> children. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main causes of homelessness is not only lack of affordable housing. Some of the main factors are in fact eviction, overcrowded
                            housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Studies show that, a majority of the street homeless have a mental illness or live with some sort of 
                            severe health problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to the U.S Census Bureau the housing affordability gap has grown
                            wider. Apartment rents have increased by 25% from 2005-2010 and rose every 
                            year following.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rise in NYC homelessness are due to two major factors.
