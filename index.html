                    <h2>In NYC alone there are over 58,000 people who are homeless</h2>
                    <p>
                        In NYC many who are homeless happen to be people of color. What seems to be agreed upon is that one of the main
                        reasons for homelessness is due to lack of affordable housing. Over <strong>19,000</strong> are apart of families and 
                        over <strong>19,000</strong> are children.

                        With so many people homeless, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/index.html#/?chapt=1" target="_blank">
                        Dasani</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/karol/">Karol</a>
                        was apart of these statistics.

                        According to the<em> Coaltition For The Homeless</em>, at least <strong>90%</strong> of the homeless are minorities. It is clear 
                        that minorities are disproportionately affected by homelessness. In recent years, the homeless population has increased and 
                        reached it's highest level since 1930's
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of the 2019 fiscal year there has been about <strong>132,660</strong> different homeless people. 
                        According to the same study, this number also includes <strong>44,300</strong> children.

                        The main causes of homelessess is not only lack of affordable housing. Some of the main factors are in fact eviction, overcrowded
                        housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studies show that, a majority of the street homeless have a mental illness or live with some sort of 
                        severe health problem.
