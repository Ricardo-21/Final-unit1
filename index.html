                    <h2>In NYC alone there are over 58,000 people who are homeless</h2>
                    <p>
                        In NYC many who are homeless happen to be people of color. What seems to be agreed upon is that one of the main
                        reasons for homelessness is due to lack of affordable housing. Over <strong>19,000</strong> are apart of families and 
                        over <strong>19,000</strong> are children. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With so many people homeless, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/index.html#/?chapt=1" target="_blank">
                        Dasani</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/karol/">Karol</a>
                        was apart of these statistics.

                    <p>
                        According to the<em> Coaltition For The Homeless</em>, at least <strong>90%</strong> of the homeless are minorities. It is clear 
                        that minorities are disproportionately affected by homelessness. In recent years, the homeless population has increased and 
                        reached it's highest level since 1930's
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of the 2019 fiscal year there has been about <strong>132,660</strong> different homeless people. 
                        According to the same study, this number also includes <strong>44,300</strong> children.

                        The main causes of homelessness is not only lack of affordable housing. Some of the main factors are in fact eviction, overcrowded
                        housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studies show that, a majority of the street homeless have a mental illness or live with some sort of 
                        severe health problem.

                    <p>
                        According to the U.S Census Bureau the housing affordability gap has grown
                        wider. Apartment rents have increased by 25% from 2005-2010 and rose every 
                        year following.

                        The rise in NYC homelessness are due to two major factors.

                        <h2>Solutions to homelessness</h2>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Federal Housing Assistance:</li>
                                <p>The most successful way to reduce homelessness because of the varity and uniqe options it provides. Housing Choice Vouchers and section 8 vouchers; these are vouchers that provide low-income families modest market-rating housing. This provides a a flexable subsidy that adjust with the family's income over time. This ensures that many families reamin stable in a home other than the shelter.</p>
                                <li>Permanent Supportive Housing:</li>
                                <p>This model combines affordable housing with suppot service and individuals living with mental illness and health conditions. Reasearch suggest that permanent supportive housing costs less than other forms of emergency and institutional care. New York Agreement is well known supportive housing initiative that successfully reduced homelessness in New York City and saved taxpayer dollars that would otherwise have been spent on costly shelters and hospitalizations.</p>
                                <li>"Housing First":</li>
                                    <p>The Housing First approach includes moving homeless individuals directly into subsidized housing and then linking them to support services, either on-site or in the community. This gives a stable housing system in the long term for homeless individuals. This approach is far less costly than emergency and institutional care,such as shelters, hospitals and correctional facilities.</p>
