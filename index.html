                        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
                        <h4>Asif Khan:</h4>
                           <p>Our mission is to raise awareness. We should be greatful for the roof on our heads. And, if you think what you live in is bad look outside and find the statistic on how many homeless people live in the streets and or are living in unstable homes. Our mission is to provide the facts and the proven solutions to homlessness and hope you can help in the slightest way. ANYTHING helps and we can tackle this one by one togather.</P>   
                           <h4>Segun Sebair:</h4>
                           <p>We care deeply about New York City, and looking at the facts hurts my soul. It is hard hearing the truth, but we have to face reality and instaed of running away we have to run toward the problem and create solutions. A better New York has an impact on all of us. While we may be comfortable in where we are we have to be uncomforable looking outside seeing all the New Yorkers without a home. </p>
                           <h4>Ricardo Villarreal:</h4>
                           <p>Our mission is to give everyone the same oppertuniy to live in a affordable home. While I am greatful to have my parents and my siblings in my life I understand there are many individuals without support. I want to be their support system becasue I know if I did no have a stable home I would want others to help me. I sleep at night thinking it is to cold in my house not knowing that there are thousands of peole sleeping outside. The great feature of social media is kn owing that this may impact one individual.</P>
