                            <p>In the past 10 years, the amount of homeless people coming into shelters is now 52% higher.</p>

                            <p>
                                According to the U.S. Census Bureau 

                                Social Security had an estimated impact on poverty rate in 2015 by -8.34%. 
                                Similar social programs such as SNAP had a -1.44%. Refundable tax credits 
                                had a -2.88%. Housing subsidies, however, only has a -0.80% impact. 
                                Unemployment Insurance has a -0.20% impact.

                            <p>
                                According to <em>endhomelessness.org</em> children who experience homelessness
                                are shown to repeat a grade, be expelled, drop out, and have lower academic
                                performance. In short, if someone experiences homelessness, they are more likely,
                                to have their kids experience homelessness and the cycle continues.

                            <p>
                                According to <em>knowledgeworks.org</em>, a lack of a high school diploma or GED is one of the top factors for 
                                young adult homelessness. According to the website, they are 4.5 times more likely to experience homelessness. As well,
                                children experiencing homeless are 87% more likely to drop out, which in turn brings us back to the previous question,
                                that it indeed does make a cycle.

                                According to <em>hhs.gov</em>, there are already services for people who are experiencing homelessness. Some of which
                                are safeline and hotlines for one to call in the cases of runaways or the victims of domestic violence, which are 
                                one of the main reasons for homelessness.
