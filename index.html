                            <p>One common problem that causes homelessness in New York is lack of affordable housing.</p>
                            <p>In the past 10 years, the amount of homeless people coming into shelters is now 52% higher.</p>

                            <p>
                                According to the U.S. Census Bureau 

                                Social Security had an estimated impact on poverty rate in 2015 by -8.34%. 
                                Similar social programs such as SNAP had a -1.44%. Refundable tax credits 
                                had a -2.88%. Housing subsidies, however, only has a -0.80% impact. 
                                Unemployment Insurance has a -0.20% impact.

                            <p>
                                According to <em>endhomelessness.org</em> children who experience homelessness
                                are shown to repeat a grade, be expelled, drop out, and have lower academic
                                performance. In short, if someone experiences homelessness, they are more likely,
                                to have their kids experience homelessness and the cycle continues.

                            <p>
                                According to <em>knowledgeworks.org</em>, a lack of a high school diploma or GED is one of the top factors for 
                                young adult homelessness. According to the website, they are 4.5 times more likely to experience homelessness. As well,
                                children experiencing homeless are 87% more likely to drop out, which in turn brings us back to the previous question,
                                that it indeed does make a cycle.

                                According to <em>hhs.gov</em>, there are already services for people who are experiencing homelessness. Some of which
                                are safeline and hotlines for one to call in the cases of runaways or the victims of domestic violence, which are 
                                one of the main reasons for homelessness.

                           <p>We care deeply about New York City, and looking at the facts hurts my soul. It is hard hearing the truth, but we have to face reality and instaed of running away we have to run toward the problem and create solutions. A better New York has an impact on all of us. While we may be comfortable in where we are we have to be uncomforable looking outside seeing all the New Yorkers without a home. </p>

                           <p>Our mission is to give everyone the same oppertuniy to live in a affordable home. While I am greatful to have my parents and my siblings in my life I understand there are many individuals without support. I want to be their support system becasue I know if I did no have a stable home I would want others to help me. I sleep at night thinking it is to cold in my house not knowing that there are thousands of peole sleeping outside. The great feature of social media is kn owing that this may impact one individual.</P>
