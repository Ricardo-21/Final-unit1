                        <h2> Three Solutions to homelessness</h2>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Federal Housing Assistance:</li>
                                <p>The most successful way to reduce homelessness because of the varity and uniqe options it provides. Housing Choice Vouchers and section 8 vouchers; these are vouchers that provide low-income families modest market-rating housing. This provides a a flexable subsidy that adjust with the family's income over time. This ensures that many families reamin stable in a home other than the shelter. One major concern is the wailist for these vouchers are intense. Many housing agencies have closed their waiting list becasue of how many applicants applied.</p>
                                <li>Permanent Supportive Housing:</li>
                                <p>This model combines affordable housing with suppot service and individuals living with mental illness and health conditions. Reasearch suggest that permanent supportive housing costs less than other forms of emergency and institutional care. New York Agreement is well known supportive housing initiative that successfully reduced homelessness in New York City and saved taxpayer dollars that would otherwise have been spent on costly shelters and hospitalizations.</p>
                                <li>"Housing First":</li>
                                    <p>The Housing First approach includes moving homeless individuals directly into subsidized housing and then linking them to support services, either on-site or in the community. This gives a stable housing system in the long term for homeless individuals. This approach is far less costly than emergency and institutional care,such as shelters, hospitals and correctional facilities.</p>
